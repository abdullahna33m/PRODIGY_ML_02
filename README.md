# PRODIGY_ML_02

 I used a support vector machine (SVM) model with an RBF kernel. The system involved preprocessing images by resizing, flattening, and scaling them before feeding them into the model. To handle the dataset, I shuffled the images to ensure a balanced selection of both cats and dogs during evaluation. I also integrated PCA for dimensionality reduction and ensured accurate performance by displaying both predicted and true labels of the test images
